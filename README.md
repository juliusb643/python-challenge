# python-challenge

For the Module 3 Python Challenge, I have a script for both PyBank and PyPoll, as well as the source code and my output txt files. 

For PyBank, the task was to analyze a company’s financial records using Python script. I did this by first finding the number of months and the profits over that time frame. Secondly, I added code to calculate the average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease. I collaborated with a couple classmates such as Victoria Martin Nelson and Kiet, and through some trial and error I was able to determine these numbers. I also consulted with the AI Learning Expert on Bootcamp Spot, and my friend Kevin Le, who works as an Analytics Engineer. While all of the numbers are correct, I will admit that my read-out has a few extra pieces to it that I’ve been unable to solve. For example, the “date” and “amount” that gets additionally printed on my terminal and text file, I’m not sure where I’m going wrong. 

For PyPoll, I was fortunate to be tutored by Lebuso Philly and work out this code. While it took a little bit to print out the formatting and get that correct, I was pleased with the speed at which we were able to figure out the code during our tutoring session. I was also able to utilize office hours with Reed Hyde, and finish making my code be clean and error-free. 

Thank you for your time, and have a great day.
